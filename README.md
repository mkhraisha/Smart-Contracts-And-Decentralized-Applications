This repository is based on the work of Dhruvin Parikh, forked from: [2022 Course Repo](https://github.com/york-blockchain/Smart-Contracts-And-Decentralized-Applications)

This repository contains assignments and the final project for this course. You will have access to all the assignments when the course starts. While you may begin working on your assignments at any time you wish, the assignments are intended to reinforce learning from the preceding Module.

The final project is intended to tie all the lessons of the course together and create a functional end to end application.
