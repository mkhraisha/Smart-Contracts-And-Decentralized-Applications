[https://faucets.blockxlabs.com](https://faucets.blockxlabs.com) 

[https://faucet.rinkeby.io](https://faucet.rinkeby.io) 

- Update the `Creature.sol` file with your token symbol and name then check this in to github

- Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and update `.env` with all required values.

- Run the npm command to test the contracts, make sure all runs green
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm test
``` 
- Run the npm command to deploy your contract to the rinkeby network

e.g. if your account that owns the token is `0xDa1d30af457b8386083C66c9Df7A86269bEbFDF8`:

[https://rinkeby.opensea.io/accounts/0xDa1d30af457b8386083C66c9Df7A86269bEbFDF8](https://rinkeby.opensea.io/accounts/0xDa1d30af457b8386083C66c9Df7A86269bEbFDF8)
